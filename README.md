# Gecko Project:

Description: The Gecko Project uses a commercially available material that simulates the setae on the toe pads of a gecko (which allow it to stick to most surfaces) to make a mechanical arm capable of picking up objects through only physical contact along a single plane, without needing to curve or bend around the object in any way.

  
## **Soft Robotics Vertically Integrated Project**

The Soft Robotics VIP at NYU researches and develops robotic systems for dealing with environments in which hard actuators (i.e. typical metal/plastic robots) would be detrimental. We work with materials like silicone and microcontrollers like Arduino to innovate new methods of movement, object manipulation, and environmental interaction.
